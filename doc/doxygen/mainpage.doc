 \section DTK_intro Introduction
 
 The Data Transfer Kit (DTK) provides parallel mesh searching and field
 mapping services for arbitrary physics codes based on the concept of 
 geometric rendezevous.

 \section DTK_FAQ FAQ

  - <b>My target points and source geometries completely overlap for a volume to volume transfer, but DTK is not finding the points in the search during the call to the setup() method.  What is happening? </b> Make sure that the source geometries have unique global IDs across the entire process space.  If a source uses the same unique global ID on different processes, only one of the sources will be used by DTK.
